I am a place to hold Magritte extensions to Object. I will be available via `anObject magritte`. My purpose is to prevent the endless bloat of Object's class-side. This seems especially relevant with a library like Magritte, whose extensions might cause extra trouble because Magritte will presumably usually be used as a library in service of other libraries (whose own extensions might accidentally collide).
